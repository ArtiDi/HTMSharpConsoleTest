# HTMSharpConsoleTest
My try of implementation HTM framework in pure C#. My pet project.
It's based primarily on Nupic https://github.com/numenta/nupic/tree/master/src/nupic, and also on HTM Java https://github.com/numenta/htm.java and HTM.Net https://github.com/ArtiDi/HTM.Net/tree/master/HTM.Net.

For now, I did implement two encoders: Scalar Encoder and RandomDistributedScalarEncoder. And now I'm in a middle of implementation of Spatial Pooler algorithm.
